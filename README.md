**Upon receiving the question, make clarifications**

* Do not jump into coding right away. Coding questions tend to be vague and underspecified on purpose to allow the interviewer to gauge the candidate's attention to detail and carefulness. Ask at least 2-3 clarifying questions.

* Paraphrase and repeat the question back at the interviewer.
This ensures that you comprehend exactly what they're
asking for.

Clarify assumptions:
* How is the input stored?

* Is the input array sorted? This will determine whether
you should use binary search or linear search.

* Clarify how large the input is and the range of values.

* Clarify whether the input could have negatives, floating-point
numbers, duplicates, null, or simply be empty.
