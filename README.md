**Upon receiving the question, make clarifications**

Do not jump into coding right away. Coding questions tend
to be vague and underspecified on purpose to allow the
interviewer to gauge the candidate's attention to detail
and carefulness. Ask at least 2-3 clarifying questions.

Paraphrase and repeat the question back at the interviewer.
This ensures that you comprehend exactly what they're asking
for.

**Clarify assumptions:**
* How is the input stored?
What data structure is being used to keep the input values
in memory so they can be processed?
E.g., an array (list in Python), a linked list, a hash map
/dictionary, or a tree/graph structure.

* Is the input sorted? This will determine whether
you should use binary search or linear search.

* Clarify how large the input is and the range of values.

* Clarify whether the input could have negatives, floating-point
numbers, duplicates, null, or simply be empty.

**Work out and optimise your approach with the interviewer.**

The worst thing you can do next is jump straight to coding -
interviewers expect there to be some time for a 2-way
discussion on the correct approach to take for the question,
including analysis of the time and space complexity.

This discussion can range from a few minutes to up to 5-10
minutes depending on the complexity of the question. This
also gives interviewers a chance to provide you with hints
to guide you towards an acceptable solution.

Are there any time/space complexity requirements/constraints?
