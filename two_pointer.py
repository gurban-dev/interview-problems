# Two-pointers pattern reduces the time complexity of
# problems that involve traversing a linear structure.
# Arrays, linked-lists, strings

# The two pointers can move in either the same direction
# or in opposite directions.

# Two pointers moving in opposite directions where the first
# begins moving from the first element and the second begins
# moving from the last element is convenient for finding
# which two elements equal the target.
