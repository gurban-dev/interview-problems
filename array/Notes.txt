Arrays hold values of the same type at contiguous memory
locations.

In an array, we're usually concerned about two things -
the position/index of an element and the element itself.

In Python, and in also JavaScript, arrays (lists in Python)
have a dynamic size which means that you don't need to have
a size defined beforehand when creating the array.
